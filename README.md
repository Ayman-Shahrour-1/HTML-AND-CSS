# HTML-AND-CSS

## 📽️ Project Highlight: The Bootstrap Cinema
The centerpiece of this repository is a responsive cinema application that demonstrates structured layout and component integration.

### **Core Deliverables:**
* **Intelligent Navigation:** A fixed Bootstrap navbar with **HTML Bookmarks**. Links for `Home`, `About`, `Showtimes`, and `Deals` jump to specific sections of the page without reloading.
* **Dynamic Jumbotron:** A high-visibility hero section acting as a portal for the cinema's branding.
* **Themed Card Deck:** A responsive grid displaying three major titles:
    * **Kong: Skull Island**
    * **Ghost in the Shell**
    * **Beauty and the Beast**
* **Interactive Showtimes:** Each movie card utilizes **Info-colored Pill Badges** (Bootstrap `badge-pill`) to display six distinct showtimes, from 12:00 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.

## 🎨 Creative HTML & CSS Features
Outside of the framework, I have implemented several custom design elements to ensure a unique user experience:

### **Visual Effects**
* **Image Styling:** Utilization of CSS filters, rounded edges (`border-radius`), and precise centering.
* **Image Overlay Fade:** Interactive hover layers that reveal text when a user engages with project images.
* **Video Integration:** A muted, autoplaying, looping background video to create a cinematic atmosphere.

### **Advanced Layouts**
* **Two-Column System:** A custom-styled two-column layout with specific height/width constraints and unique font colors.
* **Styled Tables:** Data organization featuring custom cell padding, borders, and a colored header row for clarity.
* **Interactive Typography:** Custom hover effects on `<p>` elements to provide tactile feedback during browsing.
